# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing Engine for Urban Parking Lots

A real-time, data-driven pricing engine for 14 urban parking spaces. This system simulates intelligent pricing based on live occupancy, traffic, queue length, and competitive lot behavior â€” built using core Python libraries and Pathway's streaming architecture.

## Overview

Urban parking spaces face frequent inefficiencies due to static pricing. This project builds a **dynamic pricing engine** that adjusts prices in real-time based on:

- Occupancy and capacity
- Queue length
- Traffic congestion
- Special events
- Type of incoming vehicle
- Competitor lot pricing (based on proximity)

The system simulates live data updates, pricing strategies, and visualizations â€” from scratch.
